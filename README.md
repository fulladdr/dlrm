I implemented DLRM Embedding Table Compression Method using XOR Interleaving Method

In addition to original embedding table compression method, I created two tables (in similar size) and used additional 4 bit index bits and used 'XOR' computation to reduce hashing conflicts

Accuracy increased and CPU utilization rate dropped significantly
